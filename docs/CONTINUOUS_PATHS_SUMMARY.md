# Continuous Lifecycle Paths - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Problem Solved

**User's concern**: "I want to ensure that dec_paths are seeded with last values of acc_paths"

**Previous issue**: Accumulation and decumulation paths were generated independently with different seeds, creating two unrelated market scenarios.

**Solution**: Created `generate_lifecycle_paths()` method that generates ONE continuous random path spanning both lifecycle phases.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### New Method: `MCPathGenerator.generate_lifecycle_paths()`

**Location**: [mc_path_generator.py:142-247](mc_path_generator.py#L142-L247)

**What it does**:
1. Generates one long continuous path at accumulation frequency (e.g., biweekly)
2. Splits into two portions:
   - **Accumulation**: First `N` periods (e.g., periods 0-233)
   - **Decumulation**: Next `M` periods (e.g., periods 234-1013)
3. For decumulation, aggregates sub-annual periods to annual returns via compounding

**Key algorithm**:
```python
# Generate continuous path at biweekly frequency
total_periods = (acc_years * 26) + (dec_years * 26)  # e.g., 9*26 + 30*26 = 1014
continuous_path = np.random.multivariate_normal(period_mean, period_cov, size=total_periods)

# Split
acc_paths = continuous_path[:234, :]          # Periods 0-233 (biweekly)
dec_portion = continuous_path[234:1014, :]   # Periods 234-1013 (biweekly)

# Compound decumulation to annual
for year in range(30):
    year_periods = dec_portion[year*26:(year+1)*26, :]  # Get 26 biweekly returns
    annual_return = np.prod(1 + year_periods, axis=0) - 1
    dec_paths[year, :] = annual_return
```

**Result**: Decumulation year 1 uses periods 234-259, year 2 uses 260-285, etc. **No gap**.

## 🧪 Validation

### Test Script: `test_continuous_paths.py`

Validates that:
1. ✅ Decumulation uses periods immediately after accumulation (period 130 → 131)
2. ✅ Annual returns correctly compound 26 biweekly periods
3. ✅ Multiple simulations all show continuity
4. ✅ Zero numerical error in compounding (difference < 1e-10)

**Run validation**:
```bash
uv run python test_continuous_paths.py
```

**Output**:
```
✓ Accumulation ends at period: 130
✓ Decumulation year 1 uses periods: 130 to 156
✓ Manually compounded annual return: [-0.05676863 -0.19572662]
✓ From dec_paths[0, 0, :]:          [-0.05676863 -0.19572662]
✓ Difference: [0. 0.]
```

## 📊 Usage Example

### Before (Independent Paths - WRONG)
```python
# OLD APPROACH - DON'T USE
acc_paths = path_generator.generate_paths(1000, 234, periods_per_year=26)

path_generator.seed = 43  # Different seed!
dec_paths = path_generator.generate_paths(1000, 30, periods_per_year=1)
# ⚠️ These are independent scenarios, not continuous!
```

### After (Continuous Paths - CORRECT)
```python
# NEW APPROACH - USE THIS
acc_paths, dec_paths = path_generator.generate_lifecycle_paths(
    num_simulations=1000,
    accumulation_years=9,
    accumulation_periods_per_year=26,  # Biweekly
    decumulation_years=30
)
# ✓ ONE continuous market scenario
# ✓ Dec starts from last acc period
# ✓ No gap, no re-seeding
```

## 🎯 Key Benefits

1. **Realistic lifecycle modeling**: Markets don't "reset" when you retire
2. **Sequence of returns risk**: Decumulation faces the market conditions from end of accumulation
3. **Proper compounding**: Annual returns correctly aggregate sub-annual periods
4. **Zero discontinuity**: Validated with numerical precision (< 1e-10 error)

## 📈 Impact on Results

With continuous paths, the sequence-of-returns risk is properly modeled:
- Poor market at end of accumulation → affects early retirement years
- Good market at end of accumulation → boosts early retirement years
- More realistic than independent scenarios

## 🔍 How to Verify Continuity

```python
from mc_path_generator import MCPathGenerator

# Generate continuous paths
generator = MCPathGenerator(tickers, mean_returns, cov_matrix, seed=42)
acc_paths, dec_paths = generator.generate_lifecycle_paths(10, 5, 26, 3)

# Check continuity
sim_idx = 0
acc_end_period = 5 * 26  # 130

# Last accumulation period
last_acc = generator.paths[sim_idx, acc_end_period-1, :]

# First decumulation period (next in sequence)
first_dec = generator.paths[sim_idx, acc_end_period, :]

print(f"Last acc period ({acc_end_period-1}): {last_acc}")
print(f"First dec period ({acc_end_period}): {first_dec}")
# ✓ These are consecutive periods in one continuous path
```

## 📝 Files Modified

   - Removed independent path generation with different seeds

3. **CLAUDE.md**:

## 🚀 Next Steps

Now that paths are continuous, you can:

1. **Study sequence-of-returns risk**: How does market timing at retirement affect outcomes?
2. **Compare strategies**: Test different asset allocations with same market sequences
3. **Validate against studies**: Compare to published retirement research (Trinity Study, etc.)
4. **Add realism**: Incorporate regime-switching models while maintaining continuity

## 💡 Technical Notes

**Why compound to annual for decumulation?**
- Withdrawals typically happen annually (or less frequently)
- Annual frequency reduces simulation complexity
- Still captures full market volatility via compounding

**Why not just use annual frequency throughout?**
- Dollar-cost averaging is lost with annual contributions
- Biweekly contributions capture intra-year market volatility
- More realistic for accumulation phase modeling

**Can I use different frequencies?**
Yes! The method supports any `accumulation_periods_per_year` (1, 12, 26, 52, 252, etc.)
